```
or
```bash
python -m pip install virtualenv
```
* create virtual environnement with the selected interpreter
```bash
python -m virtualenv --python=path/to/installed/interpreter .venv

command above will create you virtual environnement with the selected interpreter
* activate your environnement

  
for linux
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
for windows

.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```



## Run Locally (system interpreter)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
*Note* : meadiapipe doesn't installed ? you're using the wrong interpreter review our steps
* run the entry point
